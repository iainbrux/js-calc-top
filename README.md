This project is in relation to The Odin Project assignment: Rock, Paper, Scissors. The objective of this assignment is to create a fully working website that is responsive to user input and plays a game against the computer of Rock Paper Scissors. This is my first full project for creating a responsive website with JavaScript, as well as styling with CSS and intergrating elements of flex box into the visual appearance. 

Remaining objectives: 

Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
Adjust the web page from alerting the user whether she has won, lost or tied and integrate it into a <h3> element.
Clean up code and make more efficient for loading times of scripts (rockpaper.js only) - [ADVANCED]
